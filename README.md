Admin Pack with Extras
======================

A PHP toolkit designed specifically for programmers to quickly create a nice-looking, custom-built, secure administrative web interface.  Choose from a MIT or LGPL license.  Proven to cut development time by at least 50% over traditional frameworks and template engines.  But it isn't a CMS nor a framework or a template engine.  Admin Pack is very different.  Give it a go to power your next PHP-based administrative backend.

Admin Pack with Extras has additional components and support for extra features, including an example mobile-ready layout.

Features
--------

* Quick-n-dirty custom administrative interface builder.
* The default template and print stylesheet looks nice.
* Integrated CSRF/XSRF defenses.
* Date picker and fancy dropdown options.
* A nice-looking default mobile layout.
* Reasonable size (~480KB).
* Has a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.
* Designed for relatively painless integration into your project.
* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.
